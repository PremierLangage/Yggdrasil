# Exo concept

This project seeks to record/create new types of exercises.

You can either add ** requests ** for new types of exercises or new types of exercises.

File organization:
if your type of exercises is very specific to a discipline put it in the adapted directory.

Otherwise, put it in the general / directory.

If you propose a type of exercises do it in two stages with a template and an example of use of the template.

If you propose an exercise engine (i.e. an exo that uses a data file with a specific format as the source of the exercise)
then place it in motor /.

# Standard lib stdlib /
This repository aims to prepare templates to become standards in the standard lib.
