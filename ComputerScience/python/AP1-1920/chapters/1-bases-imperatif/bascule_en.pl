title= A swing

text==
The goal of this exercise is to have a line of code of the form:

     var = expression

such that the value of *var* passes successively from the value **{{val1}}** to the value **{{val2}}**
then from the value **{{val2}}** to the value **{{val1}}**, each time the line is executed.

Write the __expression__ that does this.
We assume that var is initialized to 0.
