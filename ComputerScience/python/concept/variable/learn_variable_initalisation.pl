# this is an activity for platon 

# this activity is created to learn python initialisers

# there are levels of competency 

# each level is associated with a learning module 
# reading the module endable you to answer the level question 
# 1 : int 
# 2 : float 
# 3 : bool
# ------ sstring needed 
# 4 : str with ',", """, ''' 
# 4.5: more strings with eaccute
# ------ tuple needed  
# 5 : tuple of int 
# 6 : tuple of any in [int, float, str, bool]
# ------ list needed 
# 7 : list of int 
# 8 : liste of any in [int, float, str, bool]
# ------ Dic needed
# 9 : dic of str, int 
# 10 : dic of any 
# 11 : recursive dÃ©finitions 
# -- lambda 
# 12 : lambda int -> int 
# 13 : filtering lambda any --> bool 
# 14 : casting lambda type --> type 

# CAVEAT : as you see the level are dependant on informations you can't know at the begening of the cours
# So this exercise with the differents level is not interesting on it's own if it 
# is complexe to write it is easyier  to create an exercice for each level.

# So be it
